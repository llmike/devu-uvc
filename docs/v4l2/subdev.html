    interface and may change in the future.</p></div><p>The complex nature of V4L2 devices, where hardware is often made of
  several integrated circuits that need to interact with each other in a
  controlled way, leads to complex V4L2 drivers. The drivers usually reflect
  the hardware model in software, and model the different hardware components
  as software blocks called sub-devices.</p><p>V4L2 sub-devices are usually kernel-only objects. If the V4L2 driver
  implements the media device API, they will automatically inherit from media
  entities. Applications will be able to enumerate the sub-devices and discover
  the hardware topology using the media entities, pads and links enumeration
  API.</p><p>In addition to make sub-devices discoverable, drivers can also choose
  to make them directly configurable by applications. When both the sub-device
  driver and the V4L2 device driver support this, sub-devices will feature a
  character device node on which ioctls can be called to

    usually merge all controls and expose them through video device nodes.
    Applications can control all sub-devices through a single interface.</p><p>Complex devices sometimes implement the same control in different
    pieces of hardware. This situation is common in embedded platforms, where
    both sensors and image processing hardware implement identical functions,
    such as contrast adjustment, white balance or faulty pixels correction. As
    the V4L2 controls API doesn't support several identical controls in a single
    device, all but one of the identical controls are hidden.</p><p>Applications can access those hidden controls through the sub-device
    node with the V4L2 control API described in <a class="xref" href="control.html" title="User Controls">the section called &#8220;User Controls&#8221;</a>. The
    ioctls behave identically as when issued on V4L2 device nodes, with the
    exception that they deal only with controls implemented in the sub-device.
    </p><p>Depending on the driver, those controls might also be exposed through
    one (or several) V4L2 device nodes.</p></div><div class="section" title="Events"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idp27608664"></a>Events</h3></div></div></div><p>V4L2 sub-devices can notify applications of events as described in

    device nodes, with the exception that it only deals with events generated by

    driver is responsible for configuring every block in the video
    pipeline according to the requested format at the pipeline input
    and/or output.</p><p>For complex devices, such as often found in embedded systems,
    identical image sizes at the output of a pipeline can be achieved using
    different hardware configurations. One such example is shown on

    scaling on the sensor is required to achieve higher frame rates. Depending
    on the use case (quality vs. speed), the pipeline must be configured
    differently. Applications need to configure the formats at every point in
    the pipeline explicitly.</p><p>Drivers that implement the <a class="link" href="media_controller.html#media-controller-intro" title="Introduction">media
    API</a> can expose pad-level image format configuration to applications.
    When they do, applications can use the <a class="link" href="vidioc-subdev-g-fmt.html" title="ioctl VIDIOC_SUBDEV_G_FMT, VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_FMT"><code class="constant">VIDIOC_SUBDEV_G_FMT</code></a> and

    time, and an <span class="errorcode">EPIPE</span> error code is then returned if the configuration is
    invalid.</p><p>Pad-level image format configuration support can be tested by calling
    the <a class="link" href="vidioc-subdev-g-fmt.html" title="ioctl VIDIOC_SUBDEV_G_FMT, VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_FMT"><code class="constant">VIDIOC_SUBDEV_G_FMT</code></a> ioctl on pad 0. If the driver returns an <span class="errorcode">EINVAL</span> error code
    pad-level format configuration is not supported by the sub-device.</p><div class="section" title="Format Negotiation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="idp27621440"></a>Format Negotiation</h4></div></div></div><p>Acceptable formats on pads can (and usually do) depend on a number
      of external parameters, such as formats on other pads, active links, or
      even controls. Finding a combination of formats on all pads in a video
      pipeline, acceptable to both application and driver, can't rely on formats
      enumeration only. A format negotiation mechanism is required.</p><p>Central to the format negotiation mechanism are the get/set format
      operations. When called with the <em class="structfield"><code>which</code></em> argument
      set to <code class="constant">V4L2_SUBDEV_FORMAT_TRY</code>, the
      <a class="link" href="vidioc-subdev-g-fmt.html" title="ioctl VIDIOC_SUBDEV_G_FMT, VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_FMT"><code class="constant">VIDIOC_SUBDEV_G_FMT</code></a> and <a class="link" href="vidioc-subdev-g-fmt.html" title="ioctl VIDIOC_SUBDEV_G_FMT, VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_FMT"><code class="constant">VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_FMT</code></a> ioctls operate on a set of
      formats parameters that are not connected to the hardware configuration.
      Modifying those 'try' formats leaves the device state untouched (this
      applies to both the software state stored in the driver and the hardware
      state stored in the device itself).</p><p>While not kept as part of the device state, try formats are stored
      in the sub-device file handles. A <a class="link" href="vidioc-subdev-g-fmt.html" title="ioctl VIDIOC_SUBDEV_G_FMT, VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_FMT"><code class="constant">VIDIOC_SUBDEV_G_FMT</code></a> call will return
      the last try format set <span class="emphasis"><em>on the same sub-device file
      handle</em></span>. Several applications querying the same sub-device at
      the same time will thus not interact with each other.</p><p>To find out whether a particular format is supported by the device,
      applications use the <a class="link" href="vidioc-subdev-g-fmt.html" title="ioctl VIDIOC_SUBDEV_G_FMT, VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_FMT"><code class="constant">VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_FMT</code></a> ioctl. Drivers verify and, if
      needed, change the requested <em class="structfield"><code>format</code></em> based on
      device requirements and return the possibly modified value. Applications
      can then choose to try a different format or accept the returned value and
      continue.</p><p>Formats returned by the driver during a negotiation iteration are
      guaranteed to be supported by the device. In particular, drivers guarantee
      that a returned format will not be further changed if passed to an
      <a class="link" href="vidioc-subdev-g-fmt.html" title="ioctl VIDIOC_SUBDEV_G_FMT, VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_FMT"><code class="constant">VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_FMT</code></a> call as-is (as long as external parameters, such as
      formats on other pads or links' configuration are not changed).</p><p>Drivers automatically propagate formats inside sub-devices. When a
      try or active format is set on a pad, corresponding formats on other pads
      of the same sub-device can be modified by the driver. Drivers are free to
      modify formats as required by the device. However, they should comply with
      the following rules when possible:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Formats should be propagated from sink pads to source pads.
	Modifying a format on a source pad should not modify the format on any

	should reset the scale factors to default values when sink pads formats
	are modified. If the 1:1 scaling ratio is supported, this means that
	source pads formats should be reset to the sink pads formats.</p></li></ul></div><p>
      </p><p>Formats are not propagated across links, as that would involve
      propagating them from one sub-device file handle to another. Applications
      must then take care to configure both ends of every link explicitly with
      compatible formats. Identical formats on the two ends of a link are
      guaranteed to be compatible. Drivers are free to accept different formats
      matching device requirements as being compatible.</p><p><a class="xref" href="subdev.html#sample-pipeline-config" title="Table&#160;4.18.&#160;Sample Pipeline Configuration">Table&#160;4.18, &#8220;Sample Pipeline Configuration&#8221;</a>

      pads (or possible even on both). Cropping is used to select the area of
      interest in an image, typically on an image sensor or a video decoder. It can
      also be used as part of digital zoom implementations to select the area of
      the image that will be scaled up.</p><p>Crop settings are defined by a crop rectangle and represented in a
      struct&#160;<a class="link" href="overlay.html#v4l2-rect" title="Table&#160;4.3.&#160;struct v4l2_rect">v4l2_rect</a> by the coordinates of the top left corner and the rectangle
      size. Both the coordinates and sizes are expressed in pixels.</p><p>As for pad formats, drivers store try and active
      rectangles for the selection targets <a class="xref" href="apb.html#v4l2-selections-common" title="Common selection definitions">the section called &#8220;Common selection definitions&#8221;</a>.</p><p>On sink pads, cropping is applied relative to the
      current pad format. The pad format represents the image size as
      received by the sub-device from the previous block in the
      pipeline, and the crop rectangle represents the sub-image that
      will be transmitted further inside the sub-device for
      processing.</p><p>The scaling operation changes the size of the image by
      scaling it to new dimensions. The scaling ratio isn't specified
      explicitly, but is implied from the original and scaled image
      sizes. Both sizes are represented by struct&#160;<a class="link" href="overlay.html#v4l2-rect" title="Table&#160;4.3.&#160;struct v4l2_rect">v4l2_rect</a>.</p><p>Scaling support is optional. When supported by a subdev,
      the crop rectangle on the subdev's sink pad is scaled to the
      size configured using the <a class="link" href="vidioc-subdev-g-selection.html" title="ioctl VIDIOC_SUBDEV_G_SELECTION, VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_SELECTION"><code class="constant">VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_SELECTION</code></a> IOCTL
      using <code class="constant">V4L2_SEL_TGT_COMPOSE</code>
      selection target on the same pad. If the subdev supports scaling
      but not composing, the top and left values are not used and must
      always be set to zero.</p><p>On source pads, cropping is similar to sink pads, with the
      exception that the source size from which the cropping is
      performed, is the COMPOSE rectangle on the sink pad. In both
      sink and source pads, the crop rectangle must be entirely
      contained inside the source image size for the crop
      operation.</p><p>The drivers should always use the closest possible

    physical busses (both between separate physical components and inside SoC
    devices). This should not be confused with the V4L2 pixel formats that
    describe, using four character codes, image formats as stored in memory.
    </p><p>While there is a relationship between image formats on busses and
    image formats in memory (a raw Bayer image won't be magically converted to
    JPEG just by storing it to memory), there is no one-to-one correspondance
    between them.</p><div class="section" title="Packed RGB Formats"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="idp27722328"></a>Packed RGB Formats</h5></div></div></div><p>Those formats transfer pixel data as red, green and blue components.
      The format code is made of the following information.
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>The red, green and blue components order code, as encoded in a
	pixel sample. Possible values are RGB and BGR.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The number of bits per component, for each component. The values
	can be different for all components. Common values are 555 and 565.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The number of bus samples per pixel. Pixels that are wider than
	the bus width must be transferred in multiple samples. Common values are
	1 and 2.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The bus width.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>For formats where the total number of bits per pixel is smaller
	than the number of bus samples per pixel times the bus width, a padding
	value stating if the bytes are padded in their most high order bits
	(PADHI) or low order bits (PADLO).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>For formats where the number of bus samples per pixel is larger
	than 1, an endianness value stating if the pixel is transferred MSB first
	(BE) or LSB first (LE).</p></li></ul></div><p>
      </p><p>For instance, a format where pixels are encoded as 5-bits red, 5-bits
      green and 5-bit blue values padded on the high bit, transferred as 2 8-bit
      samples per pixel with the most significant bits (padding, red and half of
